[LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org) is "a simple base class for creating fast, lightweight web components".

CrystallineElement is a subclass of LitElement which provides a number of useful enhancements inspired by [Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org). It's written in Ruby-like syntax and compiled by [Ruby2JS](https://github.com/rubys/ruby2js). While it can be used in any Javascript context (since of course it's transpiled to ES6+ Javascript), it's primarily intended for use in Ruby2JS environments.

_Documentation coming soonâ€¦_
